# Bespoke, Multifunctional Class

### A LaTeX Class designed to make my documents magnificent in style as well as content

Want to see how it looks? Take a peek at [the documentation](documentation/bmc.pdf).

This project was heavily inspired, and initially built off the fantastic work of @HarveySheppard (see [yLaTeX](https://github.com/HarveySheppard/yLaTeX)).

It is currently a work-in-progress, and will likely remain such until I am happy with it (i.e. indefinitely).

If anybody out there happens to like this and use it, good for you :smiley:.
Furthermore (as unlikely as this may be), if anybody does so and has an idea for, or even implements an improvement do be sure to give me a shout or open a PR. I'd really appreciate it :grin:
